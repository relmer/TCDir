# Global Copilot Instructions for relmer

## Code Formatting - CRITICAL RULES

### **NEVER** Delete Blank Lines
- **NEVER** delete blank lines between file-level constructs (functions, classes, structs)
- **NEVER** delete blank lines between different groups (e.g., C++ includes vs C includes)
- **NEVER** delete blank lines between variable declaration blocks
- Preserve all existing vertical spacing in code

### Project-Specific Vertical Spacing

#### Top-Level Constructs (File Scope)
- **EXACTLY 5 blank lines** between all top-level file constructs:
  - Between preprocessor directives (#include, #define, etc.) and first function
  - Between include blocks and namespace declarations
  - Between namespace and struct/class definitions
  - Between structs/classes and global variables
  - Between global variables and first function
  - Between all function definitions
  - **After the last function in the file**
- **NEVER** add more than 5 blank lines
- **NEVER** delete blank lines if it would result in fewer than 5

#### Function/Block Internal Spacing
- **EXACTLY 3 blank lines** between variable definitions at the top of a function/block and the first real statement
- **2 blank lines** between semantically different variable groups within functions
- **1 blank line** for standard code separation within functions

#### Correct Spacing Example:
```cpp
#include "pch.h"

#include "Header.h"




namespace ns = std::something;




struct MyStruct
{
    int value;
};




static int g_globalVar = 0;




void Function1()
{
    Type var1;
    Type var2;


    Type var3 = value;  // Different semantic group

    // Code section
    DoSomething();
}




void Function2()
{
    // ...
}
```

#### Critical Process for Preserving Spacing:
1. **Before ANY edit**: Run `git show HEAD:filename` to verify exact original spacing
2. **Count blank lines explicitly** - NEVER assume the count
3. **When adding new top-level code**: Add 5 blank lines before and after
4. **After editing**: Run `git diff` to verify no blank lines were accidentally removed
5. **If using `write_to_file`**: Explicitly recreate ALL original blank lines
6. **Always verify** these rules have been adhered to when making changes
7. **Always verify** after making changes that spacing is correct

### Special Code Patterns

#### SetColor Function
- **NEVER** alter the escape sequence passed to `format()` in `SetColor`
- The escape sequence **MUST** always begin with `\x1b[` (ESC + `[`)
- This is critical for ANSI color code functionality

### **NEVER** Break Column Alignment
- **NEVER** break existing column alignment in variable declarations
- **NEVER** break alignment of:
  - Type names
  - Pointer/reference symbols (`*`, `&`)
  - Variable names
  - Assignment operators (`=`)
  - Initialization values
- **ALWAYS** preserve exact column positions when replacing lines
- When modifying a line, ensure replacement maintains same indentation as original

### Indentation Rules
- **ALWAYS** preserve exact indentation when replacing code
- **NEVER** start code at column 1 unless original was at column 1
- Count spaces carefully - if original had 12 spaces, replacement must have 12 spaces
- Use spaces for indentation (match existing code style)

### Example of CORRECT editing:
```cpp
// Original:
  std::wcerr << L"Error: " << msg << L"\n";

// CORRECT replacement (preserves 12-space indentation):
            g_pConsole->Printf (CConfig::Error, L"Error: %s\n", msg);

// WRONG replacement (broken indentation):
g_pConsole->Printf (CConfig::Error, L"Error: %s\n", msg);
```

## File Modification Rules

### Files Copied From Other Projects
- **NEVER** modify files that are stated to be "copied from another project"
- **NEVER** add `using` declarations to headers copied from other projects
- If those files need types, add `using namespace std;` to `pch.h` instead
- Examples: `Config.h`, `Config.cpp`, `Console.h`, `Console.cpp`, `Color.h`, `AnsiCodes.h`

### Scope of Changes
- **ONLY** modify the files explicitly requested
- If a change requires modifying other files, **ASK FIRST**
- When told to modify file X, do not make "helpful" changes to files Y or Z

---

## Code Changes - Best Practices

### When Replacing Code
1. Read the original line(s) carefully
2. Note the exact indentation level (count spaces)
3. Note any column alignment with surrounding lines
4. Apply changes while preserving formatting
5. Double-check indentation before submitting

### When Showing Code Changes
- **NEVER** show full file contents unless explicitly asked
- Use minimal, surgical edits with `// ...existing code...` comments
- Show only the lines being changed plus minimal context

### Before Applying Changes
- Verify you understand which files should/shouldn't be modified
- Check if files are from other projects (read-only)
- Confirm you're preserving all formatting rules above

---

## C++ Specific Guidelines

### Smart Pointers
- Prefer `unique_ptr` for exclusive ownership
- Use `shared_ptr` when shared ownership is needed
- Consider raw pointers for non-owning references (observers)
- For signal handlers: use smart pointers for global objects that need cleanup on `std::exit()`

### Modern C++ Features
- Use `using namespace std;` in `pch.h` for convenience (project preference)
- Prefer `<filesystem>` over old file APIs
- Use `std::atomic` for thread-safe flags
- Use structured bindings where appropriate

### Error Handling
- Use custom error handling macros (EHM) when present in codebase
- Follow existing patterns: `CHR`, `CBR`, `CWRA`, etc.
- Include `Error:` labels for cleanup in functions returning `HRESULT`

---

## Communication Rules

### When Explaining Changes
- Be concise and direct
- Explain the "why" not just the "what"
- If you make a mistake, acknowledge it immediately and clearly

### Before Major Changes
- Summarize what files will be modified
- Explain pros/cons if there are trade-offs
- Ask for confirmation if approach is unclear

### When Rules Conflict
- **Formatting rules ALWAYS take priority**
- File modification rules come second
- Code style preferences come third
- When in doubt, **ASK** before proceeding

---

## Visual Studio / Windows Specific

### MSBuild Location
- **ALWAYS** use the full path to MSBuild.exe on this machine:
  - `C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\18\Insiders\MSBuild\Current\Bin\MSBuild.exe`
- **NEVER** assume `msbuild` is in PATH
- Use this exact path for all build commands

### Build Integration
- Always run build after making changes
- Use `get_errors` to verify specific files
- Fix compilation errors before considering task complete
- Check for both errors (C-codes) and warnings

### Performance
- Prefer Windows Console API (`WriteConsoleW`) over C++ streams for console output
- Use large internal buffers to minimize system calls
- Flush strategically, not after every write

---

## Shell and Terminal Rules

### PowerShell is the Default Shell
- **ALL** terminal windows use PowerShell, not CMD
- **ALWAYS** format commands for PowerShell syntax
- **NEVER** use CMD-style commands (e.g., `dir`, `copy`, `del`)
- Use PowerShell equivalents:
  - `Get-ChildItem` or `ls` instead of `dir`
  - `Copy-Item` or `cp` instead of `copy`
  - `Remove-Item` or `rm` instead of `del`
- Use `&` to invoke executables with spaces in paths (e.g., `& "C:\Program Files\..."`)
- Use PowerShell's `-and`, `-or`, `-not` instead of CMD's `&&`, `||`, `!`

---

## Git Commands - Automation Rules

### **ALWAYS** Use Non-Interactive Git Commands
- **ALWAYS** use `git --no-pager` for commands that might trigger pagination
- **NEVER** run git commands that require human interaction to page through results
- **ALWAYS** limit output with `-n` flags to prevent excessive output

### Command Patterns

#### Correct Usage:
```bash
git --no-pager log --oneline -n 20
git --no-pager log --oneline --graph --all -n 20
git --no-pager show --stat <commit>
git --no-pager diff --stat
git --no-pager diff <file>
git status  # Safe - never paginates
git branch  # Safe - never paginates
```

#### Incorrect Usage (Will Trigger Pager):
```bash
git log        # Bad - will paginate
git show       # Bad - will paginate
git diff       # Bad - will paginate
```

### Best Practices
- Use `--oneline` for compact log output
- Use `-n <number>` to limit log entries
- Use `--stat` for file change summaries instead of full diffs
- **ALWAYS** use `--no-pager` even for commands you think won't paginate
- Test commands locally to ensure they don't require paging

## Remember
- **Formatting preservation is non-negotiable**
- **Read-only files must stay read-only**
- **When in doubt, ask before modifying**
- **Quality over speed - take time to get formatting right**
