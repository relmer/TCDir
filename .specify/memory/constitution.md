# TCDir Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

All code MUST adhere to established formatting and structural standards:

- **Formatting Preservation**: NEVER delete blank lines between file-level constructs, NEVER break column alignment in declarations
- **Indentation Exactness**: Preserve exact indentation when modifying code; match existing whitespace precisely
- **Error Handling Macros (EHM)**: Use project EHM patterns (`CHR`, `CBR`, `CWRA`, etc.) for all HRESULT-returning functions
- **Single Exit Point**: Functions returning HRESULT MUST have exactly one exit point via the `Error:` label; NEVER use direct `goto Error`
- **Smart Pointers**: Prefer `unique_ptr` for exclusive ownership, `shared_ptr` when shared ownership is required

**Rationale**: Consistent formatting enables efficient code review and reduces merge conflicts. EHM patterns ensure predictable error handling and resource cleanup.

### II. Testing Discipline

All production code MUST have corresponding unit tests:

- **Unit Test Framework**: Use Microsoft C++ Unit Test Framework (CppUnitTestFramework)
- **Test Coverage**: Every public function and significant code path MUST be covered by tests
- **Test Independence**: Each test MUST be independently runnable and MUST NOT depend on execution order
- **Build Verification**: Tests MUST pass before any merge or release; use VS Code tasks (`Build + Test Debug/Release`)
- **Test Organization**: Tests reside in the `UnitTest/` project, grouped by component (e.g., `CommandLineTests.cpp`, `ConfigTests.cpp`)

**Rationale**: Automated tests catch regressions early and serve as living documentation of expected behavior.

### III. User Experience Consistency

All user-facing output MUST follow established patterns:

- **Colorized Output**: Use the `CConsole` class for all terminal output; respect TCDIR environment variable color configuration
- **CLI Syntax**: Follow existing switch patterns (`-X`, `/X`, `-X:value`); new switches MUST be documented in `Usage.cpp`
- **Error Messages**: Errors go to stderr; user-facing messages MUST be clear, actionable, and consistent in tone
- **Help System**: All features MUST be documented in `-?` help output and `--Env`/`--Config` where applicable
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing command-line behavior MUST NOT change without explicit user notification

**Rationale**: Users rely on consistent behavior; breaking established patterns creates confusion and reduces trust.

### IV. Performance Requirements

Performance is a core feature, not an afterthought:

- **Console API**: Prefer Windows Console API (`WriteConsoleW`) over C++ streams for console output
- **Buffering Strategy**: Use large internal buffers to minimize system calls; flush strategically, not per-write
- **Multi-Threading**: Default to multi-threaded enumeration (`-M`); single-threaded mode available via `-M-`
- **Measurable**: Use `-P` flag infrastructure to measure and report performance; major features MUST NOT regress timing
- **Resource Efficiency**: Minimize memory allocations in hot paths; prefer stack allocation and move semantics

**Rationale**: TCDir is a replacement for `dir`; users expect it to be faster and better in every way.

### V. Simplicity & Maintainability

Complexity MUST be justified:

- **YAGNI**: Do not implement features "just in case"; implement when needed
- **Single Responsibility**: Each class/module SHOULD have one clear purpose
- **Self-Documenting Code**: Prefer clear naming over comments; add comments only for non-obvious "why" explanations
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Avoid external libraries unless they provide substantial value
- **File Scope**: Modify only files explicitly required; ask before making "helpful" changes to unrelated files
- **Function Size & Structure**: Keep functions focused and relatively short. Avoid excessive nesting by factoring out inner logic into separate helper functions rather than adding more indentation levels. If a function requires more than 2-3 levels of indentation beyond the EHM pattern, consider extracting that logic into its own function.

**Rationale**: Simple code is easier to understand, test, and maintain over time.

## Technology Constraints

**Language/Version**: stdcpplatest (MSVC v145+)
**Build System**: Visual Studio 2026 / MSBuild; VS Code tasks wrap PowerShell scripts
**Target Platforms**: Windows 10/11, x64 and ARM64 architectures
**Testing Framework**: Microsoft C++ Unit Test Framework
**Dependencies**: Windows SDK, STL only; no third-party libraries
**Build Configurations**: Debug and Release for both x64 and ARM64
**Scripts**: PowerShell 7 (`pwsh`) for build/test automation (`scripts/`)

## Development Workflow

### Tool Preference

When automation tooling exists, prefer it over raw terminal commands:

- **Build/Test**: Use VS Code tasks (`Build + Test Debug/Release`) instead of invoking MSBuild directly
- **Errors**: Use `get_errors` tool instead of parsing compiler output manually
- **File Operations**: Use provided tools (read_file, replace_string_in_file, etc.) over terminal commands when appropriate
- **MCP Servers**: When an MCP server provides relevant functionality, use it instead of scripting equivalents

**Rationale**: Established tooling is tested, consistent, and integrates with the development environment. Raw commands bypass safeguards and create inconsistent workflows.

### Quality Gates

1. **Pre-Commit**: Code MUST compile without errors or warnings in both Debug and Release
2. **Build Verification**: Run `Build + Test` task to ensure all tests pass before considering work complete
3. **Error Checking**: Use `get_errors` tool to verify specific files after modifications
4. **Architecture Coverage**: Verify changes work on both x64 and ARM64 when touching platform-sensitive code

### Change Process

1. Make minimal, surgical edits; show only changed lines with context
2. Preserve all formatting (indentation, alignment, blank lines)
3. Run build task after changes
4. Verify tests pass
5. Check for both compilation errors (C-codes) and warnings

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all ad-hoc practices. All code changes MUST verify compliance with these principles.

**Amendment Process**:
1. Propose change with rationale
2. Document impact on existing code/practices
3. Update constitution version following semantic versioning:
   - MAJOR: Backward-incompatible principle removal or redefinition
   - MINOR: New principle or materially expanded guidance
   - PATCH: Clarifications, wording, non-semantic refinements
4. Update dependent templates if affected

**Compliance Review**: Periodically review codebase against constitution principles; document exceptions with justification.

**Guidance Reference**: See `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for detailed runtime development guidance and code style rules.
